## 🚀 Deployment (Vercel)

The project is now optimized for **Vercel Serverless Functions**.

1.  **Fork/Clone** this repository to your GitHub account.
2.  Go to the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new) and **Import** this project.
3.  **(Optional but Recommended)**: Add your `credentials.json` content as an Environment Variable named `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` for secure Google Sheets exports.
4.  **Deploy!** Vercel handles the Python backend (`api/`) and HTML frontend (`public/`) automatically.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### The Genetic Engine
1.  **Initialize**: Randomly generates a population of 100+ candidate schedules.
2.  **Evaluate**: Scores each schedule based on Hard Violations (penalties) and Soft Preferences (bonus).
3.  **Evolve**: Uses **Tournament Selection** and **Single-Point Crossover** to combine the best "genes."
4.  **Repair**: A specialized post-processing step fixes overlapping labs and room segregation errors.
5.  **Converge**: Stops once a conflict-free (Fitness > 0) schedule is found or max generations are reached.

## 🔧 Local Development

1.  **Clone & Install**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jishnuthacker/Time_Table_Ai-project.git
    cd api/ && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..
    ```
2.  **Run Locally**:
    ```bash
    python server_local.py
    ```
3.  **Access**: Open `http://localhost:8080`.
